# RE4_Utility
A tool that rolls together all the file formats I've broken down over the years from resident evil 4. 

I have my own method for reading XML files buts very slow and messy so I'm using rapidXML at this time.
This means that there is also a dependancy on RapidXML for the time being while I exploring using XML as a data transmission format
